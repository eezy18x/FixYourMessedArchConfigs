🛠️ FixYourMessedArchConfigs

A small but powerful repo where I share my working Arch Linux config files just in case you’ve messed up your Arch system and need a reference to get things running again. <br>

📦 What's Inside <br>
 
 A working /etc/pacman.conf

 A correct and fresh /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

 Other useful config files from a clean, functional Arch setup

These configs helped me fix my own messed-up system — now I’m sharing them in case someone else is going through the same frustration. <br>

✅ Use With Caution <br>

These files work on my setup and may not fit every Arch install. Double-check before replacing your own files — always back up first! <br>

🧠 Why I Made This <br>

I broke my system while tweaking things, this repo is my way of helping others avoid the same pain, and to make rebuilding easier next time.
