🛠️ FixYourMessedArchConfigs

A small but powerful repo where I share my working Arch Linux config files — just in case you’ve messed up your Arch system and need a reference to get things running again.
📦 What's Inside

    A working /etc/pacman.conf

    A correct and fresh /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

    Other useful config files from a clean, functional Arch setup

These configs helped me fix my own messed-up system — now I’m sharing them in case someone else is going through the same frustration.
✅ Use With Caution

These files work on my setup and may not fit every Arch install. Double-check before replacing your own files — always back up first!

🧠 Why I Made This

I broke my system while tweaking things — this repo is my way of helping others avoid the same pain, and to make rebuilding easier next time.
